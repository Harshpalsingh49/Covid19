This repository contains SQL queries related to COVID-19 analysis. The queries are designed to show various statistics related to the global impact of the pandemic such as:

1) Total population vs infected percentage
2) Highest infected countries
3)Countries with highest death count per population
4)Continents with the highest death count per population
5)Percentage of population that has received at least one COVID vaccine
6)Population vs vaccination ratio by location
7)Highest vaccinated location
8)Top 5 vaccinated locations



All of these queries use data from a SQL Server database that is assumed to have the necessary tables and columns to support the analysis. The data used in these queries is from February 2020 to January 2023 and may not reflect the latest updates.

To use these queries, simply copy and paste them into your SQL Server management software and run them against your database. You may need to make modifications to the queries based on the structure of your database.

Note: Before running the queries, ensure that the database is up to date with the latest COVID-19 information and that all necessary permissions have been granted.
